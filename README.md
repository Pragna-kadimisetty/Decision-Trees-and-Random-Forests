# Heart Disease Prediction using Tree-Based Models

 Project Summary
This project applies **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease from clinical data.  
The models are evaluated for accuracy, visualized, and analyzed for overfitting and feature importance.
